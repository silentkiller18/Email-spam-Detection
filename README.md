# Email Spam Detection 📧🚫

Welcome to the Email Spam Classifier project! This project aims to classify emails as spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques.

## Overview ℹ️

This project contains a Streamlit web application that allows users to input a message and get a prediction on whether the message is spam or not. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model built with Python's `scikit-learn` library.

## Features ✨

- Input any message to classify as spam or non-spam.
- Easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.
- Fast and efficient prediction using a pre-trained model.
- Built with Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-classifier.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd email-spam-classifier 
```
3.Install dependencies:
